Developed a Django-based web site for a logistics company, featuring user authentication, vehicle data entry, and secure data management. Users can register, log in, and submit vehicle details such as weight and fuel consumption, which are automatically saved to an Excel file. An admin panel allows authorized users to download the compiled data. The project emphasizes secure access, data integrity, and responsive design.
